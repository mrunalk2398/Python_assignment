# 7. Inheritance
''' A, B and C are classes. A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B. Create three methods in each class,
2 methods are specific to each class and third method (override method) should be in all three Classes A, B and C.
Create a class with main method. Create an object for each class A, B and C in main method and call every method of each class 
using its own object/instance. Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C classâ€™s objects
Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members/Instance variables, Repeat the above process only for data members '''
